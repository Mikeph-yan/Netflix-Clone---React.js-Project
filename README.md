# Netflix Clone - React.js Project

Developed a Netflix-inspired web application using React.js, leveraging TMDB API for fetching movie data and Axios for handling HTTP requests. This project demonstrates proficiency in building responsive UIs, integrating third-party APIs, and managing state in React.

2. Responsive UI: Designed a Netflix-like user interface with a focus on responsiveness and user experience.

3. YouTube Integration: Embedded YouTube trailers for movies, with a default trailer displayed on page load.
